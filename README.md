# Explorative Data Analysis and AI with Tensorflow and Keras

## Dataset
`Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` dataset brought from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/data). If the CSV is not already downloaded, download it. Rename the filename as `Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` in root directory of this repository.

## Terms
Jupyter notebook: [DataAnalyticsAI_Tensorflow_Keras.ipynb](DataAnalyticsAI_Tensorflow_Keras.ipynb). Do not confuse with [test.ipynb](test.ipynb) which is another Jupyter notebook, which contains test data and code to try out before including it as a new functionality with the notebook or any part of the assignment.

## File Structure
| Filename                               | Role of the file in this project                                                                                           |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DataAnalyticsAI_Tensorflow_Keras.ipynb | This notebook is the **main** file of the project, which contains or runs (by importing other python modules) all the project components.   |
| Telco-Customer-Churn.csv               | The dataset; refer to **Dataset** section                                                                                  |
| open-jupyter-notebook.bat              | For Windows users; run the .bat file to open Jupyter lab on the root directory of the repository.                          |
| requirements.txt                       | `pip install -r requirements.txt` downloads all the dependencies (Python modules) needed. Modules such as numpy are not seen in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) but are installed still. |
| test.ipynb                             | left this file for any code which I worked on, related to the project, but does not form an integral part of the solution. |
| Xy.npz                                 | Created by Jupyter notebook [DataAnalyticsAI_Tensorflow_Keras.ipynb](DataAnalyticsAI_Tensorflow_Keras.ipynb). Numpy arrays `X` and `y`. Used by `bulk_training.py` |
| bulk_training.py                       | Code for bulk training. Improved from bulk training section found in the Jupyter notebook. It prints graphs to files. Can be run by itself or can be run from Jupyter notebook. |
| output_model_different_random_seeds.py | Makes visualisations on the results of the models built with different random seeds.                                       |
| selected_row.txt | generated by [output_model_different_random_seeds.py](output_model_different_random_seeds.py) to choose in my opinion the best set of random seeds from the models built |

| Folder name                            | Role of the folder in this project                                                                                                           |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| modelStructures_learningRates          | outputs, graphs and final-results for a subset of the combinations of model structures and learning rates                                    |
| randomSeeds                            | output (1 file), graphs (folder and file) and final-results for a subset of the combinations of model structures and learning rates          |

### Graphs in `randomSeeds` folder
There is [graphs](randomSeeds/graphs) folder like in [modelStructures_learningRates](modelStructures_learningRates) folder, containing graphs for each set of random seeds.
There is also a file [graphs-random-seeds_model_visualizations_based_on_output.pdf](randomSeeds/graphs-random-seeds_model_visualizations_based_on_output.pdf) which shows collective information on all the sets of random seeds.

## Running the files and getting the outputs and graphs
Every available file is either already available or can be generated from the Jupyter notebook.
 - The [Jupyter notebook](DataAnalyticsAI_Tensorflow_Keras.ipynb) imports (and hence runs) the [bulk_training](bulk_training.py) module, after saving `X` and `y` numpy arrays in [numpy archive](Xy.npz).
   The [bulk_training](bulk_training.py) module imports/runs [output_model_different_random_seeds](output_model_different_random_seeds.py) module at the end of the script.
Note that **imports/runs** are the same **in this context** since their driver code is on the outside of the script, i.e. no need to call any function.

 - [graphs-random-seeds_model_visualizations_based_on_output.pdf](randomSeeds/graphs-random-seeds_model_visualizations_based_on_output.pdf) is generated by [output_model_different_random_seeds.py](output_model_different_random_seeds.py). All the other files found in [modelStructures_learningRates](modelStructures_learningRates) and [randomSeeds](randomSeeds) are generated by the [bulk_training](bulk_training.py) module.
