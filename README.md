# Explorative Data Analysis and AI with Tensorflow and Keras

## Dataset
`Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` dataset brought from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/data). If the CSV is not already downloaded, download it. Rename the filename as `Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` in root directory of this repository.

## File Structure
| Filename                               | Role of the file in this project                                                                                           |

| DataAnalyticsAI_Tensorflow_Keras.ipynb | This notebook is the main file of the project, containing all the project components.                                      |
| Telco-Customer-Churn.csv               | The dataset; refer to **Dataset** section                                                                                  |
| open-jupyter-notebook.bat              | For Windows users; run the .bat file to open jupyter lab on the root directory of the repository.                          |
| requirements.txt                       | `pip install -r requirements.txt` downloads all the dependencies (Python modules) needed.                                  |
| test.ipynb                             | left this file for any code which I worked on, related to the project, but does not form an integral part of the solution. |
